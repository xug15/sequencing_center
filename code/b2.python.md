## readlines(): Read all lines in a file at once
There are at least two ways read all lines in a file. First, we can use readlines function. Python’s readlines function reads everything in the text file and has them in a list of lines. Here is how to use Python’s readlines after the opening file.
```py
# Open the file with read only permit
f = open('my_text_file.txt', "r")
# use readlines to read all lines in the file
# The variable "lines" is a list containing all lines in the file
lines = f.readlines()
# close the file after reading the lines.
f.close()
```
Another way to read lines at once is to simply use
```py
# read all lines at once
lines = list(f)
```

## Read a Text File Line by Line Using While Statement in Python

```py
#Open the file with read only permit
f = open('my_text_file.txt')
# use readline() to read the first line 
line = f.readline()
# use the read line to read further.
# If the file is not empty keep reading one line
# at a time, till the file is empty
while line:
    # in python 2+
    # print line
    # in python 3 print is a builtin function, so
    print(line)
    # use realine() to read next line
    line = f.readline()
f.close()
```

## Read a Text File Line by Line Using an Iterator in Python

```py
fh = open('my_text_file.txt')
for line in fh:
    # in python 2
    # print line
    # in python 3
    print(line)
fh.close()


```
