# Singularity

## Setup

First, install brew if you do not have it already.
```sh
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

Next, install Vagrant and the necessary bits.
```sh
brew cask install virtualbox
brew cask install vagrant
brew cask install vagrant-manager
```

## Option 1: Singularityware Vagrant Box
We are maintaining a set of Vagrant Boxes via Vagrant Cloud, one of Hashicorp many tools that likely you’ve used and haven’t known it. The current stable version of Singularity is available here:
[singularityware/singularity-2.4](https://app.vagrantup.com/singularityware/boxes/singularity-2.4/versions/2.4)

For other versions of Singularity see our Vagrant Cloud repository.
```sh
mkdir singularity-vm
cd singularity-vm
```

Then issue the following commands to bring up the Virtual Machine:

```sh
vagrant init singularityware/singularity-2.4
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
```
You are then ready to go with Singularity 2.4!

```sh
vagrant@vagrant:~$ which singularity
/usr/local/bin/singularity
vagrant@vagrant:~$ singularity --version
2.4-dist

vagrant@vagrant:~$ sudo singularity build growl-llo-world.simg shub://vsoch/hello-world
