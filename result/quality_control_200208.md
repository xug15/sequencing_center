## 总结
* 细胞 CHO-1 去完接头后，RPF建库长度分布异常。
* 细胞 CHO-2 去完接头后，RPF建库长度分布异常。
* 植物 col-dmso 去完接头后，RPF建库长度分布正常，主峰为31nt。
* 植物 col-sl 去完接头后，RPF建库长度分布正常，主峰为31nt。
* 植物突变体 d14-dmso 去完接头后，RPF建库长度分布正常，主峰为31nt。
* 植物突变体 d14-sl 去完接头后，RPF建库长度分布正常，主峰为31nt。
* FLY-B 去完接头后，RPF建库长度分布出现双峰，主峰为28nt。
* FLY-WT 去完接头后，RPF建库长度分布出现双峰，主峰为28nt。

## 结论

* 在同一批次下，植物建库长度分布全部正常，而细胞 CHO 长度分布异常, 果蝇的眼睛的长度分布出现双峰。
* 植物的建库方法成熟，建议可以大规模测序。
* 细胞建库有问题，建议重新提供样品建库。
* 果蝇的眼睛建库出现双峰，建议重新提供样品建库。
